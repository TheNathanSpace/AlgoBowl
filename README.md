## Usage

Frankly I'm not an expert in getting C++ code to run on different systems. But you should be able to run it in CLion like this:

1. Open `algo_impl` as a project in CLion.
2. Edit the run configurations to set the working directory to the `algo_impl` directory (e.g. `/home/nathan/CLionProjects/AlgoBowl/algo_impl`).
3. Run the project.

You'll be prompted for a graph input file, which should be placed in the `algo_impl` directory. Output files will be in the same directory (probably will be changed).
